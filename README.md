# Hospital-Management-System
A full-stack web based application for arranging doctor appointments.

1. To Excute this website you need to have XAMPP/MAMP or any local server provider application installed.
2. Run the Apache and SQL servers in the control panel.
3. Have all the files Extracted in folder(hospital) in htdocs folder of XAMPP application location.
4. Import the hospital.sql file in PhpMyAdmin.
5. Extract JS and CSS.
6. Now you can view the side by entering "htpps://127.0.0.1/hospital" (for XAMPP) in any of your browser address bar.

You can DEFINITELY make changes to the code or add more to make the application as you desire it to be! Happy coding...cheers!
